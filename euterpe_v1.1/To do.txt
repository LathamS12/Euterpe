Planned for Euterpe 2.0:

Gui:
	Run text onto multiple lines:
		Free play 
		Chords
	Flat notes	
	options gui/heads up display

Quiz
Add minor scale to degree quiz

Piano staff gui
	get staff image? or draw
	get note images
	get notes working w/key presses


Tests
	Music database tests

Refactoring
	separate gui into a class? if so, gui into its own file
	Freeplay as a class, could then write & attach an analysis class
	
bug fixes
free play is double counting inversions

Longer term ideas:
Keyboard gui
